# Goodreads first year ML practice project

in this project i have used KNN and Random Forest in order to check if there is a correlation between 
The average_rating of the books in Goodreads and
1. the language of the book
2. num_pages
3. ratings_count 
4. text_reviews_count

during the project i have faced an Imbalanced data set and have used an Up-sampling method to try and solve the problem 

the Project is devided to the following sections:

1.Data Overview

2.Data Cleaning

3.Data Adjusting

4.Applying Machine Learning Model

 4.1. K-nearest neighbors
 
5.The Problem 

6.Random Forest

7.Up-Sampling the minority classes as a solution

8.KNN after re-sampling and comparison
